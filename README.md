# Multiple-Regression-Try-outs
beginning work on multiple regression
This is a working attempt at mulitple regression w/ 3 independent variables. There is a fuel cost variable and a CPI variable but
but the CPI has had the energy component removed so the effect of fuels is not doubled in the model.
Because I am a beginner Pythonist there is a lot of testing and data validation the code. It for sure is possible
to remove a lot of that detail to slim down the code to about 8 lines but it is useful to understand how the model is going to perform
as a predictor.
At the end is a 3-D plot that worked out pretty well.
